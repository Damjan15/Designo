# Designo - Custom Designs And Digital Solutions Company
A multi-page website for Designo, a software comapny that is in the industry for over 10 years. My job was to only create the multi-page website, without any functionality.

### The Challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Interactive menu on mobile screens

### Built with
- React.JS
- TailwindCSS and Custom CSS

### Continued Development
There are a lot of functionalities to add in the future. Such as:
- [ ] Submiting the contact form and showing error messages if there are empty input fields.
- [ ] The data should be fetched from a CMS like GhostCMS
- [ ] Integrate real-life locations in the location section
